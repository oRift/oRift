 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Rift's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey at 8, when I was inspired by brother to code. Since I was a huge fan of Roblox, playing that game every day, I booted up Roblox Studio, not knowing what to do. I looked at a few tutorials, and then I started programming in Luau. I was doing commissions for people after, for in-game currency. Then my brother introduced me to HTML and taught me a few things about it, so I was hooked. I looked at a few tutorials and started getting the hang of it. I am still continuing my journey as a developer.
