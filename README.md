 <summary><h3>Summary of riftcodes</h3></summary>
   I've been coding since I was 8 years old. Inspired by my brother coding, I decided to make games on Roblox Studio, as that was the game I played alot. I've been continuing on making games for over 5 years now, having experience in Lua. Since it got boring after a long time, I decided to switch to Python. I am still learning but once I'm done learning Python, I will move to many more languages in the future.
